# Example Mutt config file for the 'forgotten attachments' patch.

# The 'forgotten attachments' patch provides a new setting for Mutt that
# alerts the user if the message body contains a certain keyword but there are
# no attachments added. This is meant to ensure that the user does not forget
# to attach a file after promising to do so in the mail.

# Search for the following keyword in the body of the email
set attach_keyword = "attached"

# Ask if the user wishes to abort sending if $attach_keyword is found in the
# body, but no attachments have been added
set abort_noattach = ask-yes

# vim: syntax=muttrc
