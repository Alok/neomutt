# Example NeoMutt config file for the skip-quoted feature.

# The 'S' (skip-quoted) command scrolls the pager past the quoted text (usually
# indented with '> '.  Setting 'skip_quoted_offset' leaves some lines of quoted
# text on screen for context.

# Show three quoted lines before the reply
set skip_quoted_offset = 3
